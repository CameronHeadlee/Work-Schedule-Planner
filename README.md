# Work-Schedule-Planner
This is a daily work schedule planner. I designed it to have one-hour intervals, making it easy for you to schedule events throughout your workday. Click in the orange text area next to the hour you would like to schedule an event for. Once you have typed the event, you would like to schedule click on the save icon within the blue box next to the hour you just scheduled an event in. After you have saved an event, a message will appear above the first hour, signaling that it has saved your event.
